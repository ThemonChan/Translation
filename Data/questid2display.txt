7012#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The conversation with Echinacea was a rather one-sided talk. You have been assigned to be Mr. Kidd's assistant so you better go speak to him.#
Mr. Kidd#

7013#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...You have expressed that you're not comfortable with doing chores and Mr. Kidd tells you to be clear with Echinacea that you don't want the task.#
Echinacea#

7014#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...Well, it was still impossible to win Echinacea over. You should just go back and help Mr. Kidd no matter what.#
Mr. Kidd#

7015#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Mr. Kidd's request was simpler than you thought. At Southwest Morroc, you must meet Rin at the underground tavern.#
Rin#

7016#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You must investigate the region where Rin was ambushed. The area is somewhere west of Abyss Lake and south of the second hill from the top of the mountain...#
Investigate the West field of Abyss Lake#

7017#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have found a Bloody Crystal of Darkness near the forest of Hugel. You should report this to Rin.#
Report to Rin#

7018#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've got the journal and a Bloody Crystal of Darkness from Rin. It's now your job to deliver these to Mr. Kidd!#
Deliver the journal and crystal to Mr. Kidd#

7019#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have delivered the journal and a crystal to Kidd, but you can't get his last words off of your mind...#
#

7020#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
All of a sudden, you started to feel furious and couldn't stop the urge to beat up those enemies.#
Stop all the Dandelions#

7021#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have found a Sealed Magic Scroll from one of the of a Dandelion Gang's bodies. It must be something important so you should bring it to Mr. Kidd.#
Report to Mr. Kidd#

7022#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You need to investigate the magic spell scroll. Echinacea knows which scholar to consult about it.#
Echinacea#

7023#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Echinacea has introduced a scholar named 'Defaria' but where is he? Is he the one baking sweet potatoes?#
Speak to Defaria#

7024#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The old scholar Defaria requested for some materials to unseal the scroll.#
30 of each Holy Water, Rune of Darkness, Bloody Rune#

7025#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You need to get all the required materials. Defaria said, 'I’ll be waiting for your return.'#
Conversation with Defaria#

7026#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The scroll is unsealed. Such scrolls are generally used by ^4d4dfforganizations to gather their members^000000. He says you should use it now but it's a question whether you should talk to Mr. Kidd first.#
#

7027#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You heard some suspicious story while investigating the building where you arrived by using the scroll. You heard that the Dandelions are fighting each other..#
Report to Mr. Kidd#

7028#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You told Mr. Kidd what you've heard from the basement in the empty house near the national border. There will be a serious internal dispute and it'd be the perfect time to raid them.#
Investigate the empty house near the national border#

7029#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Rayan Moore is finally caught. Mr. Kidd will take him to Rin so she can interrogate him. Find out more details from Mr. Kidd#
Conversation with Mr. Kidd#

7030#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Mr. Kidd has given you the Bloody Crystal of Darkness as well as a journal. Your last assignment is to bring the journal to Rin#
Deliver the journal to Rin#

7031#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Rayan has escaped. Or, could it be Satan Morocc who took him? You must give the pattern number of the magic wavelength to Echinacea with the journal.#
The pattern number is [SDHF92F-SDF]#

7032#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Rayan has escaped. Or, could it be Satan Morocc who took him? You must give the pattern number of the magic wavelength to Echinacea with the journal.#
The pattern number is [VWNM94GVWN90]#

7033#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Rayan has escaped. Or, could it be Satan Morocc who took him? You must give the pattern number of the magic wavelength to Echinacea with the journal.#
The pattern number is [CM3-TRDFGHE0]#

7034#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Echinacea is analyzing the pattern number to detect the magic wavelength strength. This could lead us to Rayan and maybe even Satan Morocc...#
#

7035#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Go to the building with a mana detector attached to it at the south of this camp and ask about the trace results.#
#

7036#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The trace failed but the Manager says that since the stone is still intact that Rayan must still be alive somewhere. Report to Echinacea and ask her if she has any ideas on tracing Rayan Moore.#
Report to Echinacea#

7037#Case closed?#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The case is closed now, but what is this thing that still lingers in your head? You should ask somebody about the Dandelion request because Echinacea isn't being too helpful.#
#

7038#Passion for Baked Sweet Potatoes#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have consulted Defaria about your concern, but all you got was a chore to gather some materials for baking sweet potatoes...#
20 Sweet Potatoes and 30 Logs#

7039#Dodging the conversation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You questioned Defaria over and over again and he seemed to start talking about Dandelion. But, he changed the subject again and asked you to deliver some sweet potatoes to Mr. Kidd.#
Deliver 2 sweet potatoes to Mr. Kidd#

7040#Dodging the conversation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
This time, the conversation got a bit deeper, but at last, all you got was a chore to deliver the sweet potatoes again...!#
Deliver 2 sweet potatoes to Echinacea#

7041#Politics is for the Politicians#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Echinacea advises that you stop questioning the motives of the politicians and trust that they will do what is in the best interest of keeping peace. Return to Defaria and thank him for the Sweet Potatoes.#

Looks like the 'Shabby Muffler' is the one from a friend of Snorren's. It was also proved that Terra was really trying to save 'Ogen' with 'Bradium's fragments'.#
Go to Ogen before it's too late#

7069#Messenger - Too late!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Looks like you're too late to save Ogen. Snorren turned his back and started to walk back to the town. You should pick up Terra.#

7414#Eclage guard's message#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Someone from Eclage wanted to meet. Ask for directions from the guard near the east exit of the Eclage plaza.# 
Talking with the guard at the east exit of Eclage.#

7415#Laphine's Chief of Staff#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Planned to meet someone based on the instructions from the Eclage guard. If lost, ask for directions from the guard again.#
Talking with the chief of staff.#

7416#Waiting to meet#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
After talking with the chief of staff, requested to meet with King of Laphines Mayor Jun. Once the wait is over, let's ask the Eclage guard again for more directions.# 
Asking for directions after waiting.#

7417#Kardui's request#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Mayor Jun did not listen to my sincere stories, but instead stated that he would listen to more of it if I were to contribute to Eclage more significantly. Let's take care of the Laphines in Eclage that need help.# 
Working for Eclage.#

7418#For Eclage 1#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Obtain ingredients to decorate Yai for the Eclage guard who is too busy. Horns of Hillslion, Mystic Horns, Horse's Hooves, 5 of each, would be sufficient.#
5 Horns of Hillslion, 5 Mystic Horns, 5 Horse's Hooves.#

7419#For Eclage 2#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Decided to deliver mails from Splendide Contact Officer as a favor for Roy the messenger who was having trouble at the edge of Bifrost due to communications getting cut off.#

7421#That's enough#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
While working on various jobs, Kardui's page reached me. Must go and meet Kardui. His office will be on the top floor when following the spiral road.# 
Talking with Kardui.#

7422#Kardui's gift#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Kardui stated that he prepared a gift that can be picked up from Chief of Staff Shenime. What could it be..#
Receiving the gift through Shenime.#

7423#A rumor about the King 1#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
During the conversation with Leo, unsettling things about Kardui were told. He didn't seem to get into the details but it was very concerning.# 
#

7424#A rumor about the King 2#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Fome shared something unexpected. It was that Laphines have been subtly disliking Kardui. This was similar to what Leo seemed to keep to himself before.# 
#

7425#A rumor about the King 3#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Connection between Cenes's despotism and Kardui was made through talking with the Laphines. It is not too serious, but it is certain that the current king Kardui is being considered in a way similar to how Cenes was.# 
#
 
7426#A rumor about the King 4#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Most recently, Kardui seemed to have become Mayor Jun in the midst of the calamity facing the entire Laphine race. They don't seem to completely disagree with his policies, but they don't seem to agree with them either.# 
#

7427#At times like this, face it straight on!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE# 
The truth behind Laphine's anxiety and fear toward Kardui could no longer be elucidated. Shouldn't this at least be communicated to the individual of interest? It might be possible to hear about the reason behind it all..# 
Talk with Kardui.#

7428#Yai of the wild#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Obtain items for the Yai for the Eclage guard Minuel who stands post every day and night.# 
10 Horns of Hillslion, 10 Mystic Horns, 10 Horse Hooves.#

7429#Wild recent trend!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The items collected by Minuel seemed to have created a sensation among the Yai decorations. Let's obtain the times regularly to keep the trend going.# 
Check with Minuel after some time.#

Let's show who's boss to Menblatt and Petals that annoy travelers. It's reported as patrolling, but it's actually elimination.# 
Eliminating Menblatt and Petals.#

7434#Kardui's big brother#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Kardui sends a letter to his big brother. Kardui's brother lives on the top flower of Biforst Tower. Let's deliver it to him.# 
Deliver the letter.#

7435#Time for reading the letter#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hisie asked for some time to read the letter. It only takes a couple of minutes, so let's wait a bit.# 
Wait until he is done reading the letter.#

7436# Avant the Scholar of Magics#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
In Kardui's letter, there was not only an introduction but also a request to look for his father, Avant the Scholar of Magics. Help Hisie to find out more about the scholar from within Eclage.# 
#

7437#Shenime's favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Could not obtain Avant's info but instead got a strange request from Shenime. Asked to gather experimental ingredients for the scholar of magics he sponsors. They are 10 Dust Balls, 10 Leaf Bookmarks.# 
10 Dust Balls, 10 Leaf Bookmarks.#

7438#Secret sponsorship#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Shenime did not share even a bit about the scholar of magics he sponsors, and asks to forget about even finding out about it. Is there anyone that knows?# 
Search for information.#

7439#The scholar of magics sponsored by Shenime#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hisie stated that if you track down Shenime, the location of the scholar might be identified as well. Find out Shenime's duties.# 
Search for information.#

7440#Minuel's witness#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Eclage guard Minuel stated that Shenime often travels east, in the opposite direction from his Yai. Discuss with Hisie.# 
Talk with Hisie.#

7441#Mail is here!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Planned to visit the scholar of magic's Yai as if Shenime is sending a mail. Hisie will confirm whether that person is Avant. Hisie will provide the information at the crossroads in front of Eclage.#
10 Dustballs, 10 Leaf Bookmarks#

7442#The identity of the scholar of magics#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The scholar of magics found through the strategy was indeed Avant. Must tell this to Kardui.# 
Talk with Kardui.#

7443#Interfere with the research!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE# 
A small revenge. Kardui and Hisie want to know what Avant is researching and want to interfere it. Could this be a small revenge of the brothers?# 
Interfereing Avant's research.#

7444#What Avant was researching#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Avant was researching on the methods to extract the Orb's magic power. Since this is dangerous information, the research materials should immediately be returned to Kardui.# 
Deliver the research materials to Kardui.#

//--Orb 

7445#Avant's back#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Researched the force behind Avant's research on the Orb. The most likely culpril is Avant's sponsor, the chief of staff. Approach the chief of staff to reveal the truth.# 
Talk with the chief of staff.#

7446#Unfruitful conversation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Talked with Shenime the chief of staff, but nothing was gained. He states that he might also have been tricked by Avant. The chief of staff was actually upset that Kardui only increased the defenses surrounding the Orb.# 
Report to Kardui.#

7447#Dilemma surrounding the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Only confirmed the distrust toward Kardui's instead of revealing more about Avant's research. The chief of staff hoped that Kardui's judgment has not weakened, and asked that he would demonstrate it.# 
Report to Kardui.#

7448#Something's not right#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
After discussing with Kardui and Hisie, it is decided that the chief of staff is indeed the most suspicious. What is the reason behind his resistance toward Kardui's actions toward the Orb?# 
Surveillance of the chief of staff.#

7449#Temptation toward the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The chief of staff asked to go to the Orb's lighting room to discuss it. I decided to let Kardui know about this after telling him to give me some time to think about it.# 
Report to Kardui.#

7450#Orb's lighting room#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Not sure why the chief of staff kept trying to lure me into the Orb's lighting room, but decided to go there even just to figure out why. Let's go along with what he wants for now.# 
Hold hands with the chief of staff.#

7451#Betrayal#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Everything is so confusing. The monster battled in the lighting room was not a subordinate of the King of Demons. They controlled me without my knowledge. Shenime the chief of staff betrayed all!# 
Report to Kardui.#

7452#Find the chief of staff!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Shenime the chief of staff, who was responsible for all these occurrences, has hidden his whereabouts. According to Hisie's sources, residual magic force was faintly felt in Bifrost.# 
Survey Northern Bifrost.#

7453#The last of the chief of staff#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The road from the north to the south in Bifrost. It used to be an open path but is currently blocked by a huge rift in the south. On the way to the rift, the chief of staff's corpse was found.# 
Report to Kardui.#

마계의 게이트에 불과한 탑이 타나토스 타워로 불리게 된 연유엔 마신 모로크의 현계 강림을 마검사 타나토스가 맞서 봉인에 성공했기 때문에 그의 이름이 붙은 것이다.#

Zelmeto has asked you to help him inspect the machines in the factory one at a time to know which one needs to be fixed. Find the 2nd control panel and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8018#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the 2nd control panel and it is completely broken. Report this back to Zelmeto.#
#

8019#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect the automatic pressure governors and to report any problems no matter how small they may seem.#
#

8020#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the automatic pressure governors and after checking more carefully, you find that it's making strange grinding noises and a few of the surface screws are loose. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8021#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now Zelmeto asked you to inspect another control panel. It's similar to the first one but bigger. It's located in the middle of the factory. Find it and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8022#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The main control panel doesn't look like it has any problems. But after tapping on its surface, you hear a disheartening hollow sound. It looks like it's missing some parts... Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8023#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect a mechanical hand that transports small objects. Find it and report your findings to Zelmeto.#

#

8025#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now you must inspect a pipe located near the large cauldrons of molten metal and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8026#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The pipe you found is bloated and worn out from long durations of being overloaded with pressure. It's a wonder it hasn't exploded yet. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8027#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The final thing Zelmeto has asked you to inspect is a bigger and more powerful conveyor. Find it and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8028#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
This last conveyor seems to have similar problems to its smaller version. Its movements are awkward, erratic and weak, and almost all of its screws are rusted. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8029#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto tells you that he needs to request an increase in the Factory Repair budget from the superintendant to make sure they have enough materials for the repairs. Find the superintendant.#
#

8030#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The superintendant refused to approve the increase in the Factory Repair budget. You'd better report the bad news to Zelmeto.#
#

8031#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto still wants to make the repairs so he has asked you to bring back ^FF000020 Flexible Tube^000000, ^FF000010 Rusty Screw^000000, and ^FF000010 Used Iron Plate^000000 so they can make the needed repairs.#

It turns out that Kaci is Hallen's cousin. After answering your questions she has gone back to running her games. Who else would know of their past?#
#

8039#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hallen tells you that his project is to learn more about how the Airships work. It could benefit you to ask someone who would be knowledgeable about Airships for yourself and report your findings to Hallen.#
#

You find out that the director at the Einbroch Laboratory has a piece of Ymir's Heart. It's worth investigating...#

You see, Thierry passed by here about a month ago, and told me that he had to visit the Odin Shrine. I wasn't sure then, but now I think he's trying to help my sister.#
#

I can't really go into the details, but I'm doing this work to find a cure for Euslan's disease. It's not curable by modern medicine...#
#

Thierry seems to have caught on to what we're really up to. I think that's why he's slowing down on his research. We better get rid of him before it's too late.#

Open the door with Las.#

11286#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Pushed the door with all your might but it didn't budge.#
Talk to Las.#

11287#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I'll contact the head office again. Will you ask the villagers about this hospital?#
Talk to the village girl on the right.#

11288#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I don't really know. The hospital has been closed for so long. It's strange for a new nurse to come.#
The village girl doesn't seem to know much. Return to Las.#

11289#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Head office wouldn't send me to a place like this if they weren't sure of themselves. Will you try to talk to another villager?#
Talk to the village man, south of the hospital.#

11290#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I'll have to report this information quickly. Sorry but will you go to the inn in the middle of the village with the nurse?#
Return to Las for now.#

11291#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
My feet hurt and I cannot move anymore. Can you go to the inn alone?#
Meet the doctor at the inn located at the center of the village.#

11292#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I can't go to the hospital right now because I have patients to look after. Can you go back with the key and tell her 'Do as you wish.'.#
Return to Las.#

11293#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Put in the key in the keyhole of the Hospital Door. But the door doesn't seem to be locked.#
Talk to Las.#

Haven't taken a good look thinking I might get caught but I do remember seeing a stick when I went there long ago after my grandmother passed away.#
Investigate hospital surroundings.#

11296#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Pulled out the deeply stuck stick. The hospital's melancholy atmosphere seems to double.#
Better take this agimat to Las.#

11297#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Will you visit my grandma, please? I'll go around to check the hospital here.#
Visit her grandmother at the west of the village a bit north from the hospital.#

Investigate the 2F entrance.#

Found an agimat. Let's look for more. Funny to run into a thing like this at a place like this?#
It's nearby.#

How did the nurse get through with the entrance bolted up?#
Return to Las.#

Wouldn't the grandmother who pasted the agimat outside of the hospital know about this agimat?#
Talk to the grandmother.#

11305#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Asked Shaman at the north of the village to create this.#
Visit Shaman at the north of the village.#

11306#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I feel something very ominous from you.#
Received an agimat. Return to Las.#

11307#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Let's paste that agimat onto the agimat we saw at the 2F entrance. It might help block the ominous energy from that one.#
Past the agimat onto the 2F entrance agimat.#

11308#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
As soon as you paste the agimat on top of the other one, the ominous energy feels faded away just like Las said.#
Feel like Las was playing you. Talk to the nurse in front of the hospital.#

11309#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've not only interrupted my job but you also brought her to the room making you responsible. Don't think of running away.#

The unknown ones.#

12293#Figures in history#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Clever asked to directly talk with the historical figures of the past through the rift device. Not sure if it is possible, but go visit Hiel.#

12297#Encountering Etran#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The location where Etran can be reached was found. It would be a good chance to confirm whether he was responsible for restoring the land.# 
Encountering Etran.#

12298#Two wishes#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Deliver Etran's necklace to Robert. Obtain Home Tree's golden leaf. Two favors were asked. Ask Hiel about the method to obtain a Home Tree leaf.# 
Two wishes.#

12299#Revisiting Robert#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It is prohibited to injure Home Tree by obtaining a leaf. However, if the creator himself provides one, it may be okay. However, wasn't Robert just abandoned in front of Home Tree last time?# 
Revisiting Robert.#

12300#Revisitng Etran#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Show Home Tree's leaf and encourage Etran. Although Robert's refusal to receive the necklace was critical...#

The girl confirmed that the corpse was her father's. I have to go back to Wuhari empty-handed since the Laphine of interest has died. Before that, let's go to Wuhuru to tell him about the Laphine he had worked with.# 
To Wuhuru.#

14140#To Wuhari#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Wuhuru shared all of his story, but that cannot be shared in its entirely to Wuhari. Go to Wuhari to at least tell him that the Laphine has died.#
